Johnny Five is a modular PowerShell toolkit built to interpret, restructure, and sanitize AI-generated text for human readability and downstream usability. Inspired by the iconic 80s robot who craved input and made sense of the world, this project embraces the same spirit of transformation: from raw machine output to clear, context-aware content.
